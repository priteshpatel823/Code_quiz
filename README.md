# Code_quiz

I developed this app to learn how to manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript and as an introduction to the use of the browser's local storage.

Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:

As a a coding bootcamp student

I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

So that I can gauge my progress compared to my peer

# Challenges

This entire activity was very difficult. I really don't understand what I'm doing with the DOM and Local storage and it took forever just to figure out how to get my timer working. I didn't understand how to display the questions individually or if I needed to use JSON methods so I couldn't move forward for the longest time. I tried looking at online sources and class examples multiple times and was still confused after 2 days with several hours of the same cycle. I feel like my comprehension is lagging compared to the pace of this subject matter.

I understood how to piece together the front-end components and organize them but not how to combine that with the functionality on the back-end.

Update: About two weeks later, I understood more about how to organize my functions and utilize click handlers to move through the questions while evaluating user choices properly (thanks to my TA, Alex). With the help of my tutor, Phil, I then came to understand the difference between the JS timer functions. Honestly, it still seemed complex in the sense of the amount of moving parts, but the structure made more sense to me.

The only thing I still don't fully understand is how to properly interact with Local Storage, but thankfully my other TA, Cassidy, helped with that. This assignment was actually incredibly challenging.
